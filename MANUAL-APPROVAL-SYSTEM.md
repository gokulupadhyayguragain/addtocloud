# 🔐 AddToCloud Manual Approval Credential System

## ✅ **System Overview**

The credential system now works as a **manual approval process** where:

1. **User requests access** → Form submission
2. **Email sent to admin** with user details + pre-generated credentials
3. **Admin manually reviews** → Decides to approve or deny
4. **Admin forwards credentials** → Only approved users get access

## 🔄 **Complete Workflow**

### **Step 1: User Request**
- User visits: http://localhost:8080
- Fills out access request form:
  - Full Name
  - Email Address  
  - Company/Organization
  - Purpose/Use Case
- Clicks "📨 Request Access"
- Gets confirmation: "Request Submitted - Pending Manual Approval"

### **Step 2: Admin Notification**

- **Subject**: `🔐 NEW ACCESS REQUEST - [Name] ([Company])`
- **Email contains**:
  - ✅ User's request details
  - ✅ Pre-generated credentials (ready to send)

### **Step 3: Manual Review Process**
- **You receive the email** with all details
- **Review the request**:
  - Check user legitimacy
  - Verify business need

### **Step 4: Credential Distribution**
